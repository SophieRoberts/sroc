			<h4>Registration</h4>
			<h6>What's Registration?</h6>
			<p>Registration is where you pay to enter. The available courses will be displayed.</p>
			<p id="red">Tip. Before asking for a start time, check the distance to the start. This could be anything from 100m to 2.5km!</p>
			<p>What you receive will depend upon whether the maps are pre-marked or not. If the maps are pre-marked, then all you will receive is a <a href="control_descriptions.html">Control Descriptions</a> sheet. If the maps are not pre-marked, you will receive a map and a control descriptions sheet, or you may receive a map with control descriptions printed on it.</p>
			<p id="red">Tip. In the latter case, keep a look out for any map corrections.</p>
			<p>If it's a colour coded event in the North West you will also need to hire an e-card (see image). There will be a small charge for the hire.</p>
			<h6>What does an orienteering map look like?</h6>
			<p>Orienteering maps are produced especially for orienteering. To begin with they are likely to have features that are unfamiliar to you. Check out the <a href="maps.html">Orienteering Maps</a> page later to find out more.</p>
			<h6>What are map corrections?</h6>
			<p>Map corrections are where there's been a change in the terrain that competitors should be aware of. For example, after a map has been printed it's not unknown for an area of forest to be felled. If there are any map corrections, you will need to copy them down onto your map. Typically you will receive a pre-printed map with the corrections already done for you.</p>
			<p id="red">Tip. A red biro is the best bet for this. Don't use a pen where the ink will run if the map gets wet!</p>
			<h6>What's a pre-marked map?</h6>
			<p>This means that the courses have been printed on the maps prior to the event and there will be no need for you to copy the course onto your map at the start.</p>
			<p id="red">Tip. If the maps are not pre-marked, take a red biro and a plastic bag with you to the start.</p>
			<h6>What's a control descriptions sheet?</h6>
			<p>This is a piece of paper that describes each control on your course. See the <a href="control_descriptions.html">Control Descriptions</a> page for more details.</p>
			<h6>What's an e-card?</h6>
			<p>Historically, competitors used to punch a paper card at each control with a pin punch. This proved that the correct controls had been visited. Increasingly this system is being replaced with e-cards, often referred to as 'dibbers'. Competitors use a small electronic punch that they insert into a base unit at each control. On returning to the finish, the data stored in the e-card is downloaded and a check made to ensure that the correct controls have been visited.</p>
			<p id="red">Tip. e-cards need to be 'cleared'. This simply means that any data from a previous event is deleted. A base unit will be supplied for this purpose. Just hold the e-card in the base unit until it beeps. This may be on the way to the start or at the start.</p>
			<h6>Aside from the control description sheet and maybe a map, do I need anything else?</h6>
			<p>It's sensible to take a whistle, in case of emergency. If the weather is very bad or the area very exposed the organisers will make this compulsory. This is also true of cagoules. In either case there will be prominent signs to this effect.</p>
			<h6>Can I wear anything?</h6>
			<p>You must wear full leg cover to guard against infection. However, T-shirts are fine . . . depending on the weather!</p>

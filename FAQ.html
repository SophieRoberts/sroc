				<h6 id="one">What is orienteering? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>Orienteering is a sport in which competitors navigate their way around a course with a map and compass. Courses are marked by a series of orange and white control flags.</p>
				<h6 id="two">Where did orienteering originate? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>Orienteering originated in Scandinavia over a hundred years ago, although it didn't get started in the UK until about forty years ago. As you may have noticed, SROC were the first club in England.</p>
				<h6 id="three">Is orienteering a global sport? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>Yes, the <a href="http://www.orienteering.org/">International Orienteering Federation</a> now has almost 60 member federations.</p>
				<h6 id="four">Are there many orienteers in Britain? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>The <a href="http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/">British Orienteering Federation</a> is made up of twelve regions with approximately 5000 members.</p>
				<h6 id="five">Does orienteering only take place on foot? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>Not any more. There's now Mountain Bike (MTB), Ski and Trail orienteering, which was devised for disabled competitors. Unfortunately there aren't too many of these types of event in Britain.</p>
				<h6 id="six">Can anyone take part? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>Yes. That's the great thing about orienteering, it's a sport that everyone can enjoy. It doesn't matter whether you're an elite runner or someone who'd like something slightly more challenging than a ramble through the woods. Courses are available for ages 8 to 80, so there's something for all the family.</p>
				<h6 id="seven">Is orienteering an individual sport? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>In most events, competitors compete alone. However, if you're just starting you could go round with a friend.</p>
				<h6 id="eight">Where do events take place? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>Originally events were held on common land and in woods and forests. More recently the sport has evolved to include open fell and city parks.</p>
				<h6 id="nine">When do events take place? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>Events are generally held on a Sunday morning. For example, here are the current <a href="fixtures.html">Fixtures</a>. Visit the <a href="event_types.html">Event Types</a> page for more information.</p>
				<h6 id="ten">Does orienteering have a season? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>Events are held throughout the year, although the majority occur between September and June / July.</p>
				<h6 id="eleven">How much does it cost? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>For a basic event, an adult entry fee would be around £3. This increases to around £10 for the National Championships. Junior (under 18s) and Student entry fees are approximately half this.</p>
				<h6 id="twelve">Do I need any equipment? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>Not to start with, outdoor clothes will be fine. If you enter more events then at some point you'll probably decide to buy a compass. Beyond that there's specialist O-kit and O-shoes but there's no need to worry about them at this stage.</p>
				<h6 id="thirteen">Do I need to join a club? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>If you're new to the sport and just want to try it, no. Further details regarding club and national membership can be found on the SROC <a href="membership.html">Membership</a> page.</p>

			<p>There is now just one type of membership and all members belong to a club (eg SROC) and BO (British Orienteering):</p>
			<p>The costs of membership are as follows:</p>
			<p>So a family of 4 would pay £5 + £5 + £2 + £2 + £5 = £19</p>
			<p>A couple would pay £5 + £5 + £5 = £15</p>
			<p>For those who are wanting some contact with the club but no longer orienteering we do offer the chance to be a ‘Friend’ of SROC. This category is free and this means you will receive the club newsletter (by email) and be welcome at social events.</p>

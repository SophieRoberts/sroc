				<h6 id="one">What is a Permanent Orienteering Course (POC)? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>It is a number of permanent control points (usually about 20) identified by sturdy wooden posts with a code and an orienteering logo carved or painted on it. All the controls are shown on an overprinted map. They are usually situated in local parks or forests owned by councils, the <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/">National Trust</a> or <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk">Forestry Commission</a>. Management of the courses may be by the owner of the land, or by the local orienteering club.</p>
				<h6 id="two">What is the purpose of a POC? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>The courses have many purposes, depending on your own specific needs. The great thing about them is that you can go at a time to suit you, on whatever day of the week you choose. If you are an experienced orienteer you may use them to fine tune some techniques, maybe pace counting, relocation or line orienteering. They are also an ideal way of introducing children and adults alike to the sport, where you can go at your own pace and spend as much time as you like figuring out the map. If you want to go in a pair or as a group, again, this is the perfect opportunity. You may have just started orienteering and are wanting to gain confidence in your skills outside of the pressures of an organized competition. So whether you're using them for training purposes or just for a more adventurous family stroll, the choice is entirely yours.</p>
				<h6 id="three">How can I find out if there is a POC near my home? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>There are Permanent Courses (POC's) all over the country, with new ones being launched every month. The North West has almost 40 courses. Unfortunately, less used courses can fall into disrepair, so the more people that make use of this excellent facility the better. The <a href="http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/">British Orienteering Federation</a> publish a booklet with a list of all Permanent Orienteering Courses in the UK, details of which can be found on our <a href="bibliography.html">Bibliography</a> page.</p>
				<h6 id="four">How do I get hold of the map? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>Generally, the map packs can be bought from Visitor or Information Centres, cafès or shops near to the start of the courses. Included in the map pack will be an instruction sheet, an overprinted map, control descriptions and suggested courses varying in levels of difficulty. The cost of the map packs varies from 50p - £1.50. If an area does not have a suitable outlet for selling the map packs they can usually be bought through local Leisure Centres, Libraries or Council offices.<p>
				<h6 id="five">Where are the POCs in Lancashire? <a href="#" id="up">to the top &#8593;</a></h6>
				<p>We only list Lancashire courses that are likely to be of interest to SROC members.</p>
